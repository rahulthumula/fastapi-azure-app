        - carton: CRTN, CARTON
      
      • Total Units Ordered
        Calculate: Measurement of Each Item * Quantity In Case * Quantity Shipped
        Example: 5lb * 10 per case * 2 cases = 100 pounds

   C. Pricing Information
      • Extended Price
        Headers to check:

        Default: if not specified "N/A"
       

   D. Additional Attributes
      • Catch Weight:
        If the item number is same in the previous item and quantity shipped is different then set "YES" 
         else N/A

      
      • Priced By
       Look for the reference "Measured in" 
        Values:
        - "per pound"
        - "per case"
        - "per each"
        - "per dozen"
        - "per Ounce"
      
      • Splitable
        -Set "YES" if:
        -if you have "YES" reference to Splitable

        Set "NO" if:
        - if you have "NO" reference to Splitable

        Set "NO" if:
        - Bulk only
        - Single unit
      
      • Split Price
        If Splitable = "YES":
        - Calculate: Case Price ÷ Quantity In Case
        If Splitable = "NO":
        - Use "N/A"

3. VALIDATION RULES
   • Numeric Checks:
     - All quantities must be positive
     - All prices must be positive
